# Explore AI Diagnostic Performance

An interactive educational tool for teaching clinicians how to interpret AI diagnostic metrics using a chest X-ray pneumonia detection example.

## Overview

This tutorial helps clinicians understand:

- **Confusion Matrix**: True positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives
- **Key Metrics**: Sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision (PPV), accuracy, F1 score
- **ROC and PR Curves**: How threshold selection affects the tradeoff between metrics
- **Prevalence Effects**: Why the same AI performs differently in high vs. low prevalence settings

## Features

- Interactive threshold slider to explore metric tradeoffs
- Three clinical scenarios: Severe Cases, Subtle Cases, and Low Prevalence
- Toggle between ROC and Precision-Recall curves
- Adjustable prevalence slider to demonstrate Bayesian effects on precision
- Clinical scenario questions with expandable answers

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. No build step or server required.
